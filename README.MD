# Quantum Challenges

This repository is dedicated to solve a 7 quantum computing problems and mostly document my solutions on them. Every problem statement was made available for me by Rodrigo Fetter, they were made available in Portuguese, so I translated it to english and attached it to the header of it's respective Jupyter Notebook followed by my approach on solving the problem.

Every problem tackles a different situation that may or may not be related with the other challenge, they are

1. The enigma of two guards, one that only lies and one that only tells the truth;
2. A propositional logic riddle that looks like a paradox;
3. Sum process in the ALU of a computer;
4. Two's complement;
5. Addition/Subtraction;
6. Multiple addition operations;
7. Time Series forecast.

The solutions are also documented in YouTube videos at [The Journey by Jose Vitor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJourneybyJoseVito).
